# Where To Stay In Tokyo When You're Traveling

The metropolis of Tokyo is the capital of Japan, the seat of the government and the Imperial family, and home to more than thirteen million residents. It's one of the great cities of the world, and it's one of the most interesting to visit. It's a fascinating mix of ancient and modern, offbeat and straight laced. The city is home to uncountable restaurants, museums, nightclubs, art galleries, shopping outlets, cultural landmarks, and a bustling vibe that never sleeps, and barely rests. 

Tokyo isn't formally one city; it's a collection of prefectures, or neighborhoods. These wards of Tokyo vary widely from one another, and offer travelers all sorts of different attractions along with a wide variety of accommodations. If you're wondering where to stay in Tokyo, first you need to pick a destination that interests you most. Here's a list of the hottest wards for travelers:

Shinjuku

The railway station in Shinjuku is the busiest in the world. If you're looking for hustle and bustle, Shinjuku is it. The area around the station is home to entertainment, shopping and business. It's a popular place for tourists because of its central location. Many businessmen get their introduction to Japan with a trip to Shinjuku, and return on vacation later. If you're looking for a nice hotel in Tokyo, Shinjuku has many.

If you're in the market for five star hotels, Tokyo has the Park Hyatt you might have seen in the movie Lost In Translation. A twin room starts at around $400 USD. Bill Murray not included. 

On the other end of the scale, a lone traveler can stay in one of Japan's famous capsule rooms for less than $40USD a night. You'll have just enough room to lounge and sleep, but with free Internet, TV, and air conditioning. For budget hotels, Tokyo can't offer a better deal.

Tokyo Station

The Tokyo Station area is another ward that allows a traveler to explore the whole city using the hub of transportation facilities nearby. You're right next to Narita airport, so getting in and out is a breeze. There are lots of office buildings in Tokyo Station, so the accommodations cater mostly to the upscale business traveler, but you'll be able to find all but the lowest budget accommodation. Tokyo day trips to any part of the area are convenient from Tokyo Station.

Tokyo luxury hotels don't come much more elegant than the Four Season at Marunouchi. Prices start at around $400USD per night, for two adults with or without one small child. 

The Ginza

The Ginza is a half-hour walk from Tokyo Station, but a world away in vibe. The Ginza might be the most famous shopping district in the world. Because of the value of every inch of land where the world comes to spend money, accommodations can be a bit steep. Step outside your door though, and you'll be able to choose from every major brand name on earth.  The name Ginza literally means silver mint. 

If you're in the market for discount hotels, Tokyo has better choices than the Ginza. But you'll still be able to rent a single room at a hotel like the Mercure, for as little as $115USD a night. 

Shibuya

If you're heading to Tokyo to go people watching, the Shibuya district is for you. Japanese hipsters flood the busy streets to see and be seen. Like most of Tokyo, there are numerous convenient subway, bus, and rail lines handy to help you explore. The dining and nightclub scene is outstanding at night. Shoppers looking for cutting edge fashion won't go wrong in Shibuya. 

There are no rock bottom rates available in Shibuya for lodging, but the rates aren't stratospheric, either. The well reviewed and centrally located Shibuya Tokyu Inn offers handsome single rooms for less than $150USD per night. Bump it up to $175USD and two can stay, breakfast in bed included. 

Roppongi

Roppongi means six trees in Japanese, but it's not famous for its greenery. The nightlife in Roppongi is the draw, and foreigners and locals alike flock to its many nightspots and cafes. There's a big embassy crowd from all over the world on view every night, too, because of the proximity to government offices. 

If you're splurging a bit on your vacation, you can stay at one of the most prestigious 5 star hotels Tokyo has to offer, the Okura. If you book far enough in advance, you can sneak in at surprisingly affordable rates; under $275 for a single room.  

Ueno

Right in central Tokyo, Ueno is another transportation hub. Ueno has more parks and temple grounds than other go-go neighborhoods. The Kaneiji Temple is a must-see destination along with the many museums clustered around it. The famous cherry blossoms of spring are in the Ueno Park. Ueno has many low to middle-priced accommodations for travelers just checking in from nearby Narita airport. 

You can stay very inexpensively in the Ueno district. For a little more money, two adults can stay at the well-appointed Mitsui Garden Hotel for a little over $150USD per night. 

Asakusa

Surrounding a seventh-century Buddhist temple, Asakusa has an atmosphere of old Japan. There are plenty of shops and eateries to keep you busy, and it's been a tourist destination, literally, for centuries. If you're a very low-budget traveler, Asakusa might be the place for you. Every kind of accommodations in Tokyo is represented here, including Japan's traditional Ryokans and small hotels. Ryokan traditional inns are like a time machine. If you picture a trip to Japan as sitting on a tatami mat at a low table surrounded by rice paper screened walls, these are the places to find it.  If you're past budget conscious and traveling on a shoestring, there are hostels and dormitories where you can stay safely and inexpensively. 

You can book a room at a clean, safe hostel in Asakusa for as little as $18USD if you don't mind eight beds in one room. 

Keep in mind that in Japan, hotels generally charge by the person, not the room, so make your plans accordingly. And there's an eight-percent tax on lodgings you'll need to keep in mind, too.
